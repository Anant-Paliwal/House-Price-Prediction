# Linear Regression with Python
Linear Regression is the simplest algorithm in machine learning, it can be trained in different ways. In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Robust Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. LASSO Regression
5. Elastic Net
6. Polynomial Regression
7. Stochastic Gradient Descent
8. Artificial Neaural Networks
9. Random Forest Regression
10. Support Vector Machine


# Comparing these metrics:

. MAE is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.
. MSE is more popular than MAE, because MSE "punishes" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.
. RMSE is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the "y" units.

All of these are loss functions, because we want to minimize them.
